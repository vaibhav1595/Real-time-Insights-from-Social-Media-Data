In this Project, I will use pre-downloaded datasets to understand the nuts and bolts of Twitter Data. In particular, I will do a thorough analysis of a hot-trend.
**_Warning: some of the tweets in the Twitter datasets contain explicit language._**

- Loaded and inspected data for topics that were hot worldwide (WW) and in the United States (US) at the moment of query
- Used json.dumps() method to have the data formatted as a pretty JSON string
- Used python's set datastructure to find the common trends between "World Trends" and "US Trends"
- Digged deeper to explore the common hot trend "#WeLoveTheEarth"
- Performed frequency analysis to get the sense of the data and Extracted useful information from retweets
- Manipulated and Visualized the data in a better and richer way
- Analysed languages used in tweets
